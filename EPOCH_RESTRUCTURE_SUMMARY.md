# Epoch Restructure Summary - Feature Engineering Separation

## Overview

Successfully separated Feature Engineering from Model Development into its own dedicated epoch. The ML pipeline now has **8 epochs** instead of 7, with Feature Engineering as a distinct phase between EDA and Model Development.

## Key Changes

### 1. New 8-Epoch Structure

**Before (7 Epochs):**
1. Research & Analysis
2. Data Wrangling
3. Data Exploration (EDA + Feature Engineering combined)
4. Model Development
5. Model Testing
6. Application Development
7. Retrospective

**After (8 Epochs):**
1. Research & Analysis
2. Data Wrangling
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA only - analysis and visualization)
4. **Feature Engineering** (NEW - transformations and feature creation)
5. Model Development (training + integrated testing)
6. Model Testing (advanced validation)
7. Application Development (deployment)
8. Retrospective (apps and review)

### 2. Directory Structure Changes

**Renamed Directories:**
- `epoch003-data-exploration` → `epoch003-exploratory-data-analysis`
- `epoch004-model-development` → `epoch005-model-development`
- `epoch005-model-testing` → `epoch006-model-testing`
- `epoch006-application-development` → `epoch007-application-development`
- `epoch007-retrospective` → `epoch008-retrospective`

**New Directory:**
- `epoch004-feature-engineering` (with `notebooks/` and `scripts/` subdirectories)

### 3. Data-Scientist-Agent Updates

The Data-Scientist-Agent now works across **TWO distinct epochs**:

**Epoch 003 - Exploratory Data Analysis:**
- Comprehensive statistical analysis
- Interactive visualizations
- Pattern and relationship identification
- Data quality assessment
- Recommendations for feature engineering
- Uses `{project}_data` MLflow experiment
- No code extraction (focus on analysis)

**Epoch 004 - Feature Engineering:**
- Design and implement feature transformations
- Create new features based on domain knowledge
- Encode categorical variables
- Scale and normalize numerical features
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Engineer interaction and polynomial features
- Uses `{project}_data` MLflow experiment
- Extracts code to `/mnt/code/src/feature_engineering.py`

### 4. MLflow Experiment Assignments

**`{project_name}_data` experiment (Epochs 001-004):**
- Epoch 001: Business-Analyst-Agent
- Epoch 002: Data-Wrangler-Agent
- Epoch 003: Data-Scientist-Agent (EDA)
- Epoch 004: Data-Scientist-Agent (Feature Engineering)

**`{project_name}_model` experiment (Epochs 005-008):**
- Epoch 005: Model-Developer-Agent
- Epoch 006: Model-Tester-Agent
- Epoch 007: MLOps-Engineer-Agent
- Epoch 008: Front-End-Developer-Agent

### 5. Code Extraction Updates

**Updated extraction schedule:**
- Epoch 001: `research_utils.py`
- Epoch 002: `data_utils.py`
- Epoch 003: (No extraction - EDA is exploratory)
- Epoch 004: `feature_engineering.py` ← **NEW**
- Epoch 005: `model_utils.py`
- Epoch 006: `evaluation_utils.py`
- Epoch 007: `deployment_utils.py`
- Epoch 008: `ui_utils.py`

### 6. Data Directory Structure

```
/mnt/data/{DOMINO_PROJECT_NAME}/
├── epoch002-data-wrangling/
│   └── synthetic_data.parquet (Max 50MB)
├── epoch003-exploratory-data-analysis/
│   └── eda_dataset.parquet
├── epoch004-feature-engineering/          ← NEW
│   └── engineered_features.parquet        ← NEW
└── epoch005-model-development/
    ├── train_data.parquet
    └── val_data.parquet
```

## Benefits of Separation

### 1. **Clearer Separation of Concerns**
- EDA focuses purely on understanding the data
- Feature Engineering focuses on transforming data for modeling
- Model Development can focus on algorithms without feature engineering complexity

### 2. **Better Workflow Control**
- User can iterate on EDA without affecting features
- Feature engineering can be refined based on EDA insights
- Models can be retrained with different feature sets

### 3. **Improved Reusability**
- Feature engineering code extracted separately
- EDA notebooks remain exploratory
- Feature transformations become reusable modules

### 4. **Enhanced Traceability**
- Clear distinction between exploratory analysis and feature creation
- MLflow tracks EDA insights separately from feature engineering
- Easier to audit what features were created and why

## Usage Examples

### Epoch 003 - EDA
```python
"Perform comprehensive EDA on credit risk data"
# → Statistical analysis
# → Correlation matrices
# → Distribution plots
# → Outlier detection
# → Pattern identification
# → Saves insights to /mnt/artifacts/epoch003-exploratory-data-analysis/
```

### Epoch 004 - Feature Engineering
```python
"Engineer features for credit risk prediction"
# → Create interaction features
# → Encode categorical variables
# → Scale numerical features
# → Handle missing values
# → Create polynomial features
# → Saves features to /mnt/data/{project}/epoch004-feature-engineering/
# → Extracts code to /mnt/code/src/feature_engineering.py
```

### Epoch 005 - Model Development
```python
"Train credit risk models with integrated testing"
# → Uses engineered features from Epoch 004
# → Trains multiple model types
# → Performs hyperparameter tuning
# → Includes basic validation metrics
# → Saves to /mnt/artifacts/epoch005-model-development/
```

## Files Modified

### Documentation
- `/mnt/code/CLAUDE.md` - Updated epoch structure, MLflow assignments, usage patterns
- `/mnt/code/.claude/agents/README.md` - Updated workflow, file organization, examples
- `/mnt/code/.claude/agents/Data-Scientist-Agent.md` - Added dual-epoch responsibilities

### Directories
- Renamed 5 existing epoch directories
- Created new `epoch004-feature-engineering/` directory

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Projects

If you have projects using the old 7-epoch structure:

1. **No immediate action required** - old structure still works
2. **For new features**: Use Epoch 004 for feature engineering
3. **Updating existing projects**:
   - Move feature engineering code from EDA notebooks to Epoch 004
   - Extract feature transformations to `/mnt/code/src/feature_engineering.py`
   - Update MLflow run tags to reflect new epoch numbers

### Data Scientist Agent Usage

When working with the Data-Scientist-Agent, specify which epoch you're working on:

```python
# Epoch 003
"Data Scientist: Perform exploratory analysis on sales data"

# Epoch 004 (separate invocation)
"Data Scientist: Engineer features for sales forecasting"
```

## Updated Workflow

**Complete 8-Epoch ML Pipeline:**

1. **Epoch 001** - Business Analyst: Requirements and research
2. **Epoch 002** - Data Wrangler: Data acquisition (50MB/12GB limits)
3. **Epoch 003** - Data Scientist: Exploratory data analysis
4. **Epoch 004** - Data Scientist: Feature engineering
5. **Epoch 005** - Model Developer: Training with integrated testing
6. **Epoch 006** - Model Tester: Advanced validation
7. **Epoch 007** - MLOps Engineer: Deployment and monitoring
8. **Epoch 008** - Front-End Developer: Streamlit applications

## Next Steps

1. Test the new workflow with a sample project
2. Verify Data-Scientist-Agent handles both epochs correctly
3. Ensure feature engineering code extraction works properly
4. Validate MLflow experiment structure with 8 epochs
5. Update any project-specific documentation
6. Train users on the new epoch structure

## Summary

The separation of Feature Engineering into its own epoch provides:
- ✅ Clearer workflow with distinct phases
- ✅ Better separation of exploratory vs. transformative work
- ✅ Improved code reusability
- ✅ Enhanced traceability and auditability
- ✅ More control over the ML pipeline

The 8-epoch structure better reflects the actual ML workflow and gives users more granular control over each phase of model development.
