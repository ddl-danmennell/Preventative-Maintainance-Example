# Agent Architecture Update Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed the Master-Project-Manager-Agent and distributed its responsibilities to specialized agents. The user is now the project manager and manually triggers each agent for each epoch.

## Key Changes

### 1. Master Project Manager Removed
- ✅ Deleted `/mnt/code/.claude/agents/Master-Project-Manager-Agent.md`
- ✅ Removed all governance orchestration logic
- ✅ Removed checkpoint handling (now manual user control)
- ✅ Removed pipeline wrapper creation (MLOps agent handles this)

### 2. MLflow Experiment Structure (2 Experiments)
**Before:** Multiple experiments per stage (e.g., `data_acquisition_{project}`, `eda_{project}`, `model_training_{project}`)

**After:** Simplified to 2 experiments total:
- **`{project_name}_data`**: All data processing (Epochs 001-003)
  - Business-Analyst-Agent: Research and requirements
  - Data-Wrangler-Agent: Data acquisition and generation
  - Data-Scientist-Agent: EDA and feature engineering

- **`{project_name}_model`**: All model operations (Epochs 004-007)
  - Model-Developer-Agent: Model training and hyperparameter tuning with integrated testing
  - Model-Tester-Agent: Advanced testing (edge cases, compliance, robustness)
  - MLOps-Engineer-Agent: Deployment and monitoring
  - Front-End-Developer-Agent: Streamlit applications

### 3. Integrated Testing in Model-Developer-Agent
**Model-Developer-Agent now includes:**
- Train/validation/test splits during training
- Performance metrics on all splits
- Confusion matrices, ROC curves, PR curves
- Feature importance and SHAP values
- Error analysis visualizations
- All saved to both `/mnt/artifacts/epoch004-model-development/` AND MLflow

**Model-Tester-Agent focuses on:**
- Edge case identification and testing
- Adversarial robustness testing
- Fairness and bias detection
- Compliance validation
- Stress testing and boundary analysis

### 4. Code Reusability - Shared /mnt/code/src/ Directory
**Before:** Project-specific directories `/mnt/code/src/{project}/`

**After:** Single shared directory `/mnt/code/src/` (all projects)

**Structure:**
```
/mnt/code/src/
├── __init__.py
├── research_utils.py          # Epoch 001 - Business Analyst
├── data_utils.py               # Epoch 002 - Data Wrangler
├── feature_engineering.py      # Epoch 003 - Data Scientist
├── model_utils.py              # Epoch 004 - Model Developer
├── evaluation_utils.py         # Epoch 005 - Model Tester
├── deployment_utils.py         # Epoch 006 - MLOps Engineer
└── ui_utils.py                 # Epoch 007 - Front-End Developer
```

**Each agent:**
1. Checks `/mnt/code/src/` for existing utilities at start
2. Imports and uses existing code when available
3. Extracts new reusable code at completion

### 5. Dual Storage (Artifacts + MLflow)
**All agents now save to BOTH locations:**
- `/mnt/artifacts/epoch00X-xxx/` - Persistent file storage
- MLflow experiments - Tracked artifacts, metrics, parameters

**Standard pattern:**
```python
# Save to artifacts directory
artifact_path = f"/mnt/artifacts/epoch00X-xxx/plot.png"
fig.savefig(artifact_path)

# Log to MLflow
mlflow.log_artifact(artifact_path)
mlflow.log_metric("metric_name", value)
```

## Workflow Changes

### Before (Orchestrated)
```
User Request → Master-Project-Manager-Agent
                ↓
        Orchestrates all agents
                ↓
        Complete pipeline
```

### After (User-Managed)
```
User manually triggers each epoch:
1. Business Analyst → Research & requirements
2. Data Wrangler → Data acquisition
3. Data Scientist → EDA & feature engineering
4. Model Developer → Training with integrated testing
5. Model Tester → Advanced validation
6. MLOps Engineer → Deployment
7. Front-End Developer → Streamlit app
```

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture**: No central orchestrator, simpler agent coordination
2. **User Control**: You manually manage project flow and epoch transitions
3. **Clean MLflow Organization**: 2 experiments instead of 6-7 per project
4. **Integrated Testing**: Basic metrics during training, advanced testing separate
5. **Shared Code Repository**: All projects contribute to and benefit from `/mnt/code/src/`
6. **Dual Storage**: Comprehensive tracking with both artifacts and MLflow
7. **No Governance Overhead**: Removed governance orchestration for now

## Domino Documentation Integration

**All agents now have access to complete Domino Data Lab documentation:**
- `/mnt/code/.reference/docs/DominoDocumentation.md` - Full platform documentation
- `/mnt/code/.reference/docs/DominoDocumentation6.1.md` - Version 6.1 specific docs

**Agents will reference this documentation when working with:**
- Workspaces and compute environments
- Data sources and datasets
- Jobs and scheduled executions
- MLflow integration and experiment tracking
- Model APIs and deployment
- Apps and dashboards
- Domino Flows for pipeline orchestration
- Hardware tiers and resource management
- Environment variables and secrets management

Each agent file now includes a "Domino Documentation Reference" section with instructions to reference the docs for accurate API usage, configuration options, and best practices.

## Files Modified

### Deleted
- `/mnt/code/.claude/agents/Master-Project-Manager-Agent.md`
- `/mnt/code/.claude/agents/.ipynb_checkpoints/Master-Project-Manager-Agent-checkpoint.md`

### Updated (with Domino Documentation References)
- `/mnt/code/.claude/agents/Business-Analyst-Agent.md`
- `/mnt/code/.claude/agents/Data-Wrangler-Agent.md`
- `/mnt/code/.claude/agents/Data-Scientist-Agent.md`
- `/mnt/code/.claude/agents/Model-Developer-Agent.md`
- `/mnt/code/.claude/agents/Model-Tester-Agent.md`
- `/mnt/code/.claude/agents/MLOps-Engineer-Agent.md`
- `/mnt/code/.claude/agents/Front-End-Developer-Agent.md`
- `/mnt/code/.claude/agents/README.md`
- `/mnt/code/CLAUDE.md`

## Next Steps

1. Test the new workflow with a sample project
2. Verify MLflow experiment structure works correctly
3. Validate code extraction to `/mnt/code/src/` functions properly
4. Ensure dual storage (artifacts + MLflow) is working
5. Test integrated testing in Model-Developer-Agent
6. Verify Model-Tester-Agent focuses on advanced validation

## Migration Notes

If you have existing projects:
- Old src structure: `/mnt/code/src/{project}/`
- New src structure: `/mnt/code/src/` (shared)
- You may need to consolidate existing utilities into the new shared structure
- MLflow experiments will need to be reorganized into the 2-experiment structure
