# Epoch 006: Model Testing

**Agent**: Model-Tester-Agent | **MLflow**: `{project}_model` | **Duration**: 2-4 hours

## Purpose

Conduct advanced validation including edge cases, fairness testing, adversarial robustness, and regulatory compliance verification.

## What You'll Do

1. **Functional Testing**: Verify model meets business requirements
2. **Performance Testing**: Measure latency, throughput, resource usage
3. **Edge Case Testing**: Test boundary conditions and adversarial inputs
4. **Fairness Testing**: Detect bias across demographic groups
5. **Compliance Testing**: Validate regulatory requirements
6. **Robustness Testing**: Test model stability under perturbations

## How to Use This Epoch

**Command Template**:
```
"Run comprehensive testing on [model] including fairness and compliance"
```

**Example Commands**:
- `"Test XGBoost credit model for fairness across age and gender groups with GDPR compliance"`
- `"Validate patient readmission model for HIPAA compliance and edge case robustness"`
- `"Test fraud detection model for adversarial attacks and performance under load"`

## Testing Categories

### 1. Functional Testing
**Business Requirements Verification**:
- Minimum accuracy/F1 thresholds met
- Prediction latency within acceptable range
- All required features handled correctly
- Edge case scenarios covered
- Input validation working

**Tests**:
- Accuracy ≥ target threshold (from Epoch 001)
- Precision/Recall balance appropriate for use case
- Model handles missing values gracefully
- Predictions consistent with business logic

### 2. Performance Testing
**Latency & Throughput**:
- Single prediction latency (ms)
- Batch prediction throughput (predictions/sec)
- Memory usage during inference
- Model loading time

**Tests**:
- 95th percentile latency < 100ms
- Throughput > 1000 predictions/sec
- Memory < 2GB during inference
- Cold start time < 5 seconds

### 3. Edge Case Testing
**Boundary Conditions**:
- Minimum/maximum feature values
- Missing value combinations
- Rare categorical values
- Out-of-distribution inputs

**Tests**:
- Model doesn't crash on extreme values
- Predictions remain within valid range
- Confidence scores calibrated
- Graceful degradation on unusual inputs

### 4. Fairness & Bias Testing
**Demographic Parity**:
- Equal treatment across protected groups
- Disparate impact analysis
- Equal opportunity metrics

**Protected Attributes** (where applicable):
- Age, Gender, Race, Ethnicity
- Geographic location
- Socioeconomic status

**Tests**:
- Demographic parity difference < 0.1
- Equal opportunity difference < 0.1
- Disparate impact ratio > 0.8
- No proxy discrimination through correlated features

### 5. Adversarial Robustness
**Attack Scenarios**:
- Small input perturbations
- Feature manipulation
- Data poisoning detection
- Model evasion attempts

**Tests**:
- Accuracy drop < 5% under small perturbations
- Prediction consistency with slight input changes
- Detects outlier/adversarial inputs

### 6. Regulatory Compliance
**Framework Verification**:
- GDPR (data privacy, right to explanation)
- HIPAA (healthcare data protection)
- NIST RMF (risk management)
- Model Risk Management (financial services)
- Ethical AI guidelines

**Tests**:
- Model explainability available (SHAP/LIME)
- Audit trail complete in MLflow
- Data lineage documented
- Compliance with identified frameworks from Epoch 001

✅ Performance benchmarks met (latency, throughput)
✅ Edge cases handled gracefully
✅ Fairness metrics within acceptable thresholds
✅ Compliance requirements verified
✅ Robustness to adversarial inputs validated
✅ Production readiness certified or issues documented

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Load model from Epoch 005
- [ ] Load test data from Epoch 004
- [ ] Run functional tests against business requirements
- [ ] Benchmark latency and throughput
- [ ] Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- [ ] Calculate fairness metrics for protected groups
- [ ] Verify regulatory compliance (from Epoch 001)
- [ ] Test adversarial robustness
- [ ] Generate comprehensive test report
- [ ] Log all results to MLflow (`{project}_model`)
- [ ] Issue production readiness certification or remediation plan
- [ ] Extract reusable code to `/mnt/code/src/evaluation_utils.py`

## Production Readiness Criteria

**Must Pass**:
- ✅ Functional tests: 100%
- ✅ Performance tests: Latency < 100ms, Throughput > 1000/s
- ✅ Edge cases: No crashes, valid outputs
- ✅ Fairness: Demographic parity < 0.1
- ✅ Compliance: All identified frameworks verified

**Optional** (with mitigation plan):
- ⚠️ Robustness: May require adversarial training

## Common Issues & Remediations

**Issue**: Model biased against protected group
**Remediation**: Rebalance training data, apply fairness constraints, use debiasing techniques

**Issue**: Slow inference latency
**Remediation**: Model optimization, quantization, ensemble simplification

**Issue**: Poor edge case handling
**Remediation**: Expand training data, add input validation, retrain with augmented data

**Issue**: Non-compliant with regulations
**Remediation**: Add explainability (SHAP), improve audit trail, document data lineage

## Next Steps

If production ready: Proceed to **Epoch 007: Application Development** for deployment.
If not production ready: Return to Epoch 004 or 005 with remediation recommendations.
